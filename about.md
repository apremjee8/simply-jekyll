Hi, I'm Akiff. You've found my corner of the internet.

I thought it would be nice to have a place online to call my own so I put together this site with the help of an [[opensource::https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/posts/how-to-setup-simply-jekyll]] project I found. For now, I'm using this site as a place to put my working thoughts and notes. A Digital Garden as they call it. 

You'll find linked posts throughout this site as it grows such as [[Why I want to write more]]. Feel free to click through and find your way around. My thoughts may not be fully complete yet or resonate with you but that's kind of the point. This is a place where I can put things that are growing and processing in my mind. 

Thanks for checking it out and I hope you enjoy it ‚úåüèΩ

## Say Hello

 I'm pretty active on [[Twitter::https://twitter.com/akiffpremjee]] these days so if anything I write resonates with or you just want to say hello, feel free to tweet or DM me **@akiffpremjee**. 

I also started writing a blog on Substack called [[Tools for Growth::https://toolsforgrowth.substack.com/]] where I nerd out about productivity apps and products. If you're into that feel free to subscribe as well!
