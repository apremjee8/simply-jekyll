title: Why I want to write more

I started this Digital Garden in the hopes of starting and building a writing habit. I haven't always enjoyed writing because I didn't like all of the formal rules that were put upon us in grade school (though I know they were important) but I do like the idea of expressing myself in my own voice and having a place where I can grow my ideas and thoughts. 

### Writing is a skill for the long run
Writing is a skill that we will always need. It doesn't matter what career your are in or what level you are at in that career. In fact, I recently listened to a podcast where Taimur Abdaal read a quote that said that the further up you go in the corporate ladder, the more your role title changes to professional writer. Writing is how we communicate our thoughts, build connections, and make sure that the things that need to get done actually do get done. 
Building this habit is especially important for me since I'm going into medicine. I think there is a big disconnect between the medical community and the rest of the world (patients, lawmakers, etc) because there is a language barrier. Doctors speak in the language of medicine, thinking in diagnoses and symptoms and this language isn't directly translatable to others. As someone in science, I need to be able to articulate my thoughts in clear ways so that I can have a bigger impact in the future. 

### Learning in Public
Not all writing has to be public (and I think that it's a good idea to have some writing that isn't public and just for yourself) but I started this Digital Garden with the idea of learning in public in mind. This seems obvious but has been coming up more and more for me ever since I started following #roamcult on Twitter. Shu Omi has a great [[video::https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpzTYxzcF8I]] on this that you should definitely check out but the basic idea is that learning in public gives you a chance to get direct and quick feedback so that you can consistently improve and learn more. You build in a feedback cycle by just posting publicly. It's scary and I'm definitely afraid of judgement and what others will think but it's also liberating and great when you find people who resonate with your ideas. 

### Finding your crowd
When you write and learn in public, you also expose yourself to people who share similar interests to you. I've recently found that [[Twitter is a great place to find your crowd]]. Posting what you write will attract people who are also interested in that thing and you can build relationships through this and be exposed to the work that others are creating as well. Sometimes it may seem like the things that you are interested in are niche and it's hard to find others who share those interests. But if you just write about your interests, then like-minded people will find you. As they say - if you build it, they will come. 

### Synthesize the content you take in
Right now, we are inundated by the amount there is to consume on a daily basis. If I look at my Instapaper, there are enough articles saved in it to last a life time. [[Putting something in our own words forces us to synthesize the information that we took in]]. This does two things - 1) it slows our brain down and lets us reflect on what we are consuming and 2) it forces us to take time out to make sure we actually understand what we are consuming. Being able to take what you read and put it in your own words is one of the best ways to truly learn something and gain an understanding of it. 

### Writing is therapeutic
There is just something relaxing and therapeutic about putting your thoughts on a page. It's a freeing feeling (at least for me) and though it might be easier to sit and binge Netflix or YouTube in your free time, I've found that after I write my mind feels better and I feel proud of having created something on my own. It's also wonderful to go back through the archives and read different things that you wrote a while back to see what your headspace was at a different time. In a world where everything is go go go, writing gives us a chance to take a break. 

In the end, writing is a habit that takes time to build. I'm new at this and I'm sure I will falter and be inconsistent with this at times. But I do hope to build on this habit so that I can see how my thoughts grow over time. This Digital Garden in conjunction with using Roam Research for the past few months is my way of doing this. I'm so excited for you to join the journey.
